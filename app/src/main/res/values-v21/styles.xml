<!--And I definitely don't suggest that you try to memorise all of this. So it's quite likely that you'll
    want to create another styles file, using an earlier API than you've already defined.
    And that's where the comment I made earlier, that these individual API version files don't inherit
    from the earlier ones, becomes important.
    Now as you can see in the v23 styles.xml file,
    we've redefined the AppTheme, dot NoActionBar theme.
    Now it does inherit from the AppTheme style defined in the original styles.xml.
    However it doesn't inherit anything from the AppTheme.NoActionBar style in there.
    When we create a v21 styles file, what we have to do is copy the complete AppTheme.NoActionBar theme
    from the original file, and then modify it.
    So let's actually do that.-->
