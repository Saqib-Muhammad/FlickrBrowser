# FlickrBrowser

This is a Flickr Browser, which will allow us to query and download a list of recent photos from the hugely popular Flickr website.

It will also be our first taste of Material Design.

Google introduced Material Design in Android 5, Lollipop (API 21) to encourage good design and allow a consistent user experience across different platforms and device sizes.

In this app we cover the following topics:
* Material design
* Compatibility with previous Android versions
* Downloading <b>JSON data from the web</b>.
* AsyncTask
* Callback functions and interfaces
* RecyclerView and RecyclerViewAdapter.
* Listening for taps on a RecyclerView,and the purpose of a GestureDetector.
* Themes and Styles, and how they work for different versions of Android.
* Our app will allow us to search for different types of photos from Flickr.
